## How do they Benefit?
There are many matchmaking services in the market. Superficially, it may appear that a central matchmaking service having prospective brides & grooms from all nationalities, religions/communities is enough, but this one-size fits all approach is over-optimistic and impractical. It would work only for a small percentage who are seeking alliances without restrictions on mother tongue, religion, nationality, etc. This is not the case for the majority.

## How is this different?
Indian society is multi-cultural and is heavily influenced by traditions. Choosing a partner outside one’s own religion… or even from a different sect of the same community is uncommon. Hence, every major matchmaking service created separate portals based on the mother tongue, religion, sect, etc of users. To serve the current demands of Indian society is paramount for any matchmaking service to succeed.
